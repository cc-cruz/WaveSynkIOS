## 1. AI/ML Features & Workflows

### AI-Driven Applications for User Experience
- **Forecast Accuracy via Machine Learning**: 
  - WaveSynk can boost forecast reliability by training predictive models on historical and real-time surf data. 
  - Example: Surfline cut its wave forecast error rate in half with ML on its 30+ year dataset and 700 live cams.  
  - Continuous retraining enables models to adapt to local quirks in swell, wind, and bathymetry.

- **Personalized Surf Forecasts**:  
  - Track user behavior (favorite spots, session history, skill level) to recommend ideal surf times/locations. 
  - Surfline’s VP of Innovation has highlighted “curating waves” for individuals, much like Netflix’s movie recommendations. 
  - WaveSynk can alert surfers when conditions match their “perfect wave” criteria (height, direction, tide, etc.).

- **AI Chatbot Support and Content Curation**:  
  - Integrate a natural language chatbot to answer queries (e.g. “Where should I surf this weekend?”) by analyzing forecast data and user preferences. 
  - AI-curated news, tutorials, or “morning briefing” summaries can keep users engaged with fresh, personalized content.

- **Computer Vision for Surf Cameras**:  
  - Automatically analyze live camera feeds for wave count, size, crowd levels, or highlight clips. 
  - Surfline’s vision AI continuously monitors HD cameras and verifies forecast accuracy in real time.
  - WaveSynk can similarly leverage image recognition to refine predictions and provide in-depth user-facing analytics.

### Machine Learning Use Cases for V1.0
- **Forecast Optimization**:
  - Combine open data (buoys, weather models) with an ML layer that corrects biases at specific breaks. 
  - Even simple neural networks can deliver more accurate localized forecasts than raw model outputs.
- **Personalized Alerts**:
  - Detect patterns in user behavior and issue push notifications when favorite conditions align (e.g. “Offshore winds + moderate swell at your local break Friday!”).
  - Delivers higher engagement and user satisfaction.
- **AI-Driven Support Chatbot**:
  - Leverage GPT-4 or similar NLP models fine-tuned on surf terminology and FAQs.
  - Offer 24/7 support (e.g. “What’s a 15s period?”) and assist new surfers in interpreting forecasts.

### Future AI-Powered Surf Video Analysis
- **AI Surf Coach**:
  - Users upload clips to receive feedback on technique—pose estimation can highlight pop-up speed, body posture, maneuver timing.
  - Potential for on-device (CoreML) analysis as hardware improves, enabling real-time feedback at the beach.
  - Modeled after existing prototypes like “Surf Coach AI,” which breaks down user videos into frames and provides step-by-step advice.
- **Technical Feasibility**:
  - Requires a large labeled dataset of surf videos plus advanced deep learning techniques.
  - Can initially run in the cloud (server-side) and migrate partially on-device as ML models become more lightweight.

## 6. Technical Roadmap

### Architecture & Infrastructure
- **Cloud-Native, Serverless**:
  - AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB (or similar) for auto-scaling, pay-per-use efficiency.
  - Modular microservices so each feature (forecast engine, user profiles, AI chat) can scale independently.
- **Data Pipeline**:
  - Scheduled lambdas/cron to fetch NOAA (WaveWatch III), ECMWF, buoy/tide data.  
  - ML-based post-processing to correct localized biases. 
  - Store final forecasts in a fast NoSQL/Redis cache for near-instant reads.

### Real-Time Data & Forecasting Engine
- **Buoy Integration**:
  - Compare buoy observations to model outputs; adjust short-term forecasts (“nowcast”) if actual swell differs from predicted.
- **Caching & Low Latency**:
  - Pre-compute forecast data for each region. Serve from in-memory or edge caching to minimize load times.
- **Scalability**:
  - Microservices can spin up/down as traffic demands.  
  - GPU-enabled cloud instances for AI-driven features as needed.
