## Introduction
This document outlines the iOS Development Plan for the Surf Condition Monitoring Program. It is intended to serve as a comprehensive guide for developers building a high-performance iOS application that aggregates surf forecast data, provides real-time alerts, and delivers an intuitive user experience. External resources and best practices are referenced throughout.

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Objectives
- Build a high-performance **iOS** application to monitor surf conditions.
- Aggregate and display forecast data from multiple sources (e.g., Spitcast, NDBC Buoys) for maximum accuracy.
- Provide real-time alerts through **Twilio SMS**.
- Offer a clean, modern UI using SwiftUI (with UIKit bridging if needed).

### 1.2 Key Features
- Multi-source forecast aggregation.
- Interactive surf spot mapping.
- Personalized user dashboards and alert configurations.
- Real-time SMS notifications.
- Accurate, user-friendly surf condition forecasts.

### 1.3 Technology Stack (iOS)
- **Language:** Swift (iOS 14+ recommended, Swift 5.0+)
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI (with UIKit bridging if required)
- **Networking:** URLSession or third-party libraries (e.g., Alamofire)
- **Data Persistence:** Core Data or Realm
- **Backend Services:** Node.js/Express server with MongoDB.
- **SMS Integration:** Twilio
- **Push Notifications:** Optional (for future enhancements)

---

## 2. iOS App Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
```plaintext
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│         iOS Application       │
│   (SwiftUI, View Models, etc.)│
└─────────────┬─────────────────┘
              │ JSON via RESTful API Endpoints
              ▼
┌─────────────▼─────────────────┐
│    Backend (Node.js/Express)  │
│  Aggregation & Forecast Logic │
└─────────────┬─────────────────┘
              │
              ▼
     [MongoDB Database]
```

- The iOS app fetches data from the Node.js backend via RESTful APIs.
- Forecast data is aggregated on the server before being returned to the app.
- Twilio SMS notifications are triggered from the backend based on user preferences stored in MongoDB.

### 2.2 Architectural Approach on iOS
1. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** or **MV (Model-View)** pattern with SwiftUI.
2. **View Models** manage data requests and transform responses for the UI.
3. **Models** mirror server data structures with any additional local properties.
4. **SwiftUI Views** render content and react to ViewModel state updates.

---

## 3. Project Setup

### 3.1 Xcode Project Creation
1. **Install Xcode:** Ensure you have the latest stable version.
2. **Create a New Project:**  
   - Select “App” under iOS.
   - Choose SwiftUI for Interface and Swift for Language.
   - Name the project (e.g., `SurfMonitor-iOS`).

3. **Project Structure**
   ```
   SurfMonitor-iOS/
   ├── App/               // Main App file and SwiftUI entry point.
   ├── Models/            // Data models (SurfSpot, Forecast, etc.).
   ├── ViewModels/        // Handles networking and business logic.
   ├── Views/             // SwiftUI view files.
   └── Services/          // Helper classes (e.g., networking).
   ```

### 3.2 Dependency Management
- Use **Swift Package Manager** to add third-party libraries.
  - **Example:**  
    In Xcode: `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`  
    URL: `https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire`
- Maintain version constraints and clean dependency tracking.

---

## 4. Networking and Data Handling

### 4.1 API Integration
- **Configuration:**  
  Store the backend’s base URL in a configuration file or environment variable.
- **Networking Layer:**  
  Create a `NetworkManager` class to handle HTTP requests.

```swift
import Foundation

enum NetworkError: Error {
    case invalidURL
    case invalidResponse
}

class NetworkManager {
    static let shared = NetworkManager()
    private init() {}

    let baseURL = "https://your-backend-url.com/api"

    func getForecast(for spotId: String, completion: @escaping (Result<[Forecast], Error>) -> Void) {
        guard let url = URL(string: "\(baseURL)/forecast/spot/\(spotId)") else {
            completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidURL))
            return
        }

        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
            if let error = error {
                completion(.failure(error))
                return
            }

            guard let httpResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse,
                  (200...299).contains(httpResponse.statusCode),
                  let data = data else {
                completion(.failure(NetworkError.invalidResponse))
                return
            }

            do {
                let forecasts = try JSONDecoder().decode([Forecast].self, from: data)
                completion(.success(forecasts))
            } catch {
                completion(.failure(error))
            }
        }.resume()
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Data Models
```swift
struct Forecast: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID = UUID()
    let time: String
    let waveHeight: Double
    let windSpeed: Double
}
```

### 4.3 View Models
```swift
import SwiftUI
import Combine

class ForecastViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var forecasts: [Forecast] = []
    @Published var isLoading = false
    @Published var errorMessage: String?

    func loadForecasts(spotId: String) {
        isLoading = true
        NetworkManager.shared.getForecast(for: spotId) { [weak self] result in
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self?.isLoading = false
                switch result {
                case .success(let data):
                    self?.forecasts = data
                case .failure(let error):
                    self?.errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

*Note: If targeting iOS 15+, consider using async/await for improved concurrency.*

## 5. UI/UX Design

### 5.1 SwiftUI Views
- **Layouts:**  
  Utilize `NavigationView`, `TabView`, `List`, and custom layouts.
- **Screens:**  
  - **Surf Spot Detail:** Display current conditions, wave height charts, and wind details.
  - **Dashboard:** Show summaries of favorite spots, upcoming forecast changes, and alert settings.

### 5.2 UI/UX Best Practices
- Follow Apple’s [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/).
- Design adaptive layouts that adjust to various screen sizes and support dynamic text.
- Ensure accessible color contrasts.

### 5.3 Interactive Elements
- **Maps:**  
  Integrate Apple Maps/MapKit in SwiftUI to display surf spot locations.
- **Charts:**  
  Use SwiftUI chart libraries or Apple’s Charts framework (iOS 16+) to visualize data.

---

## 6. User Authentication and Authorization

### 6.1 Backend Integration
- The backend handles registration, login, and JWT token issuance.
- Securely store tokens in the Keychain.

### 6.2 Authentication Flow
- **Login:**  
  Users input credentials.
- **Token Handling:**  
  On successful login, store the token securely.
- **Protected API Calls:**  
  Include the token in request headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
- **Logout:**  
  Clear stored tokens and reset the app state.

### 6.3 Password Security
- Ensure all server communication occurs over HTTPS.
- Direct users to secure endpoints for password resets or account recovery.

---

## 7. Twilio Integration (SMS Alerts)

### 7.1 Alert Preferences
- Users can configure alert conditions (e.g., wave height, wind speed) in their profile.

### 7.2 SMS Flow
- The backend monitors surf conditions and triggers SMS alerts using Twilio.
- The app enables users to set and adjust their alert preferences.

### 7.3 Optional: Local Notifications
- Optionally implement local or remote notifications to supplement Twilio SMS.

---

## 8. Data Persistence

### 8.1 Local Caching
- **Core Data:**  
  Cache forecast results for offline access.
- **Realm:**  
  An alternative for a NoSQL-like local database.

### 8.2 Sync Strategy
- Fetch the latest data on app launch or user action.
- Update the local cache accordingly and display offline data when needed.

### 8.3 Handling Large Data Sets
- Consider on-demand fetching or pagination to manage memory usage efficiently.

---

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Unit Testing
- Use XCTest to test View Models and utility classes.

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import SurfMonitor_iOS

class ForecastViewModelTests: XCTestCase {
    func testLoadForecastsSuccess() {
        let viewModel = ForecastViewModel()
        let expectation = self.expectation(description: "Load Forecasts")

        viewModel.loadForecasts(spotId: "123")
        // Use mocks or stubs for NetworkManager in real tests

        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
            XCTAssertFalse(viewModel.forecasts.isEmpty)
            expectation.fulfill()
        }

        waitForExpectations(timeout: 5)
    }
}
```

### 9.2 UI Testing
- Employ XCUITest to verify primary user flows, such as login and viewing forecasts.

### 9.3 Integration Testing
- Run end-to-end tests with a local server environment to simulate network requests.

### 9.4 Performance Testing
- Utilize Xcode Instruments to identify memory leaks and rendering bottlenecks.
